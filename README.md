### [Quantum Measurement](https://github.com/Siddharth8800/Quantum-Adventures/blob/main/testingCollapseProb.ipynb)
This notebook showcases my application to demonstrate the phenomena of quantum measurement. I use a random state vector and an `Initilization` gate to demonstrate it.

### [Quantum Teleporation](https://github.com/Siddharth8800/Quantum-Adventures/blob/main/quantumTeleportation.ipynb)
This notebook has my first attempt at performing quantum teleporation. I have used both the State vector simulator and a QASM simulator to showcase the results observed.
